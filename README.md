Yearly project about what I've done in class.

This project is done with what we've done in class, I'll be constantly updating
this project with daily pushes. This Java Project has different packages from
class exercises, challenges and evaluable activities. I will probably add some
codes of my own and other things I'll be doing apart from school. There's also
a package with exercices that I'm doing on Hyperskill. Feel free to look at it.
